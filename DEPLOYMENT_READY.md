## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Current Status
- ✅ Code is committed to `tsbuild` branch
- ✅ Build is successful and optimized
- ✅ All functionality tested and working
- ⚠️  Git push requires authentication update

### To Deploy:

1. **Update Git Authentication** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://[your-token]@github.com/mounir1/mounir1.github.io.git
   ```

2. **Push to Remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin tsbuild
   ```

3. **Merge to Main** (for GitHub Pages deployment):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge tsbuild
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build the application
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Make it available at https://mounir1.github.io

### Manual Deployment Alternative
If GitHub Actions isn't available, you can deploy manually:
```bash
npm run build
# Upload contents of 'dist' folder to your hosting provider
```
