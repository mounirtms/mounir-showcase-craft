# ðŸš€ Upload Projects to Firebase

## Method 1: Automatic Seeding (Recommended)

The projects will be automatically uploaded when you first visit your portfolio and no projects exist in Firebase.

1. **Start your application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Visit your portfolio**: Open http://localhost:5173
3. **Projects will auto-seed**: The system will detect no projects and automatically upload them

## Method 2: Manual Upload via Browser Console

1. **Open your portfolio**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Open browser console**: Press F12 â†’ Console tab
3. **Run upload command**:
   ```javascript
   // Upload projects (keeps existing data)
   uploadProjects()
   
   // OR clear all and upload fresh data
   clearAndUploadProjects()
   ```

## Method 3: Admin Dashboard Upload

1. **Access admin dashboard**: 
   - Triple-click the signature in footer, OR
   - Visit http://localhost:5173/admin directly
2. **Sign in with Google** or email/password
3. **Go to "Upload Data" tab**
4. **Click "Upload Projects"** or **"Clear & Upload"**

## Method 4: Firebase Console (Manual)

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Firestore Database**
4. **Create collection**: `projects`
5. **Add documents manually** using the project data from `src/data/initial-projects.ts`

1. Ensure you're signed in to admin dashboard
2. Check Firebase security rules allow writes
3. Verify internet connection
4. Check browser console for detailed errors

### Firebase Security Rules

Make sure your Firestore rules allow authenticated writes:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /projects/{projectId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Success Indicators
