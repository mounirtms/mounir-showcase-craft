# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current admin dashboard is implemented as a large monolithic component (1260+ lines) that handles authentication, project management, skills management, and various administrative functions. This creates maintainability issues, performance concerns, and makes the codebase difficult to navigate and extend. The goal is to optimize the admin dashboard by splitting it into smaller, focused components, enhancing the layout and grid systems, and improving the overall user experience with better organization and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Architecture Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the admin dashboard to be split into smaller, focused components, so that the codebase is more maintainable and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin dashboard is loaded THEN the main Admin.tsx file SHALL be under 200 lines
2. WHEN viewing the component structure THEN each component SHALL have a single responsibility
3. WHEN a component needs to be modified THEN it SHALL be isolated from other components
4. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL be implemented as separate components
5. IF a component exceeds 150 lines THEN it SHALL be further decomposed into smaller components

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Layout and Grid System

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want an improved layout with better grid systems and responsive design, so that I can efficiently manage content across different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL adapt responsively
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the grid system SHALL use CSS Grid and Flexbox optimally
3. WHEN content overflows THEN proper scrolling and pagination SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN multiple cards are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent spacing and alignment
5. IF the viewport is mobile THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically with touch-friendly controls

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the dashboard to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I can work efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN initial render time SHALL be under 2 seconds
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the transition SHALL be under 500ms
3. WHEN large datasets are displayed THEN virtual scrolling or pagination SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN components are not visible THEN they SHALL be lazy loaded
5. IF data changes THEN only affected components SHALL re-render

### Requirement 4: Modular Component Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the admin components to be modular and reusable, so that I can easily maintain and extend the dashboard functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new admin features THEN existing components SHALL be reusable
2. WHEN components share functionality THEN common logic SHALL be extracted to custom hooks
3. WHEN styling components THEN consistent design tokens SHALL be used
4. WHEN handling state THEN it SHALL be managed at the appropriate component level
5. IF components need to communicate THEN they SHALL use proper event handling or context

### Requirement 5: Enhanced User Interface Components

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want improved UI components with better visual hierarchy and interactions, so that I can navigate and use the dashboard more intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN visual hierarchy SHALL be clear and consistent
2. WHEN interacting with components THEN feedback SHALL be immediate and appropriate
3. WHEN viewing data tables THEN they SHALL support sorting, filtering, and bulk operations
4. WHEN forms are displayed THEN they SHALL have proper validation and error handling
5. IF actions are destructive THEN confirmation dialogs SHALL be presented

### Requirement 6: Code Organization and File Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized file structure for admin components, so that I can quickly locate and modify specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for admin components THEN they SHALL be organized in logical directories
2. WHEN components share types THEN they SHALL be defined in shared type files
3. WHEN utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be in dedicated utility files
4. WHEN hooks are used THEN they SHALL be in a dedicated hooks directory
5. IF constants are defined THEN they SHALL be in a constants file

### Requirement 7: State Management Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized state management in the admin dashboard, so that data flows efficiently and components remain performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing global state THEN it SHALL use appropriate state management patterns
2. WHEN local state is needed THEN it SHALL be kept at the component level
3. WHEN data is fetched THEN loading and error states SHALL be properly handled
4. WHEN forms are used THEN form state SHALL be managed efficiently
5. IF state updates occur THEN they SHALL not cause unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Data Tables and Lists

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want improved data tables and lists with better functionality, so that I can efficiently manage large amounts of data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing data tables THEN they SHALL support column sorting and filtering
2. WHEN selecting multiple items THEN bulk operations SHALL be available
3. WHEN tables have many rows THEN pagination or virtual scrolling SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN data is loading THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be shown
5. IF no data is available THEN empty states SHALL be displayed with helpful actions

### Requirement 9: Database Schema Alignment and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the admin dashboard to follow a proper database schema for skills and projects, so that data is consistent and properly structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing skills THEN the data structure SHALL follow a defined schema with proper validation
2. WHEN managing projects THEN the data structure SHALL follow a defined schema with proper validation
3. WHEN data is saved THEN it SHALL be validated against the schema before persistence
4. WHEN viewing data THEN it SHALL be displayed according to the schema structure
5. IF schema validation fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided

### Requirement 10: Theme System and Visual Customization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between dark and light themes, so that I can use the portfolio in my preferred visual mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL detect and apply the user's preferred theme

3. WHEN the theme changes THEN all components SHALL update their colors consistently
4. WHEN the theme preference is set THEN it SHALL persist across browser sessions
